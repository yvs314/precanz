The library contains large SOP problems. 
A description of the problems can be found in the paper "Ant colony systems for large sequential ordering problems" by Montemanni, Smith and Gambardella.

The file contains for each entry of the distance matrix the corresponding value, with -1 in case there is a precedence constraint.
